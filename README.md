# Talk to Multiple AIs Through Claude Code

🚀 **Make Claude Code even smarter by connecting it to Google Gemini, Grok-3, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek!**

**⚡ You can use any combination - just the ones you have API keys for!**

Instead of switching between different AI websites, now you can simply ask Claude Code to get help from other AIs. Just say things like:

> "Hey Claude, ask all the AIs to help debug this code"  
> "Claude, get Grok's opinion on this architecture"  
> "Have Gemini and ChatGPT debate this technical decision"

## 🤖 Which AIs Are Included?

- **🧠 Gemini** (Google) - Free API ✅
- **🚀 Grok-3** (xAI) - Paid API ✅  
- **💬 ChatGPT** (OpenAI) - Paid API ✅
- **🔮 DeepSeek** - Paid API ✅

**💡 You don't need all of them!** Start with just Gemini (it's free), then add others if you want.

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### What You Need
- Claude Code installed
- At least one API key (Gemini is free!)

### Installation (Copy & Paste These 3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Download the code
git clone https://github.com/RaiAnsar/claude_code-multi-AI-MCP.git
cd claude_code-multi-AI-MCP

# 2. Run the automatic setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3. That's it! Start using it right away
```

**During setup, you'll be asked for API keys:**
- **Gemini** (Free): [Get key here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) 
- **Grok** (Paid): [Get key here](https://console.x.ai/) 
- **OpenAI** (Paid): [Get key here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

**💡 Pro tip:** Start with just Gemini (it's free), then add others later if you want.

### Test It Works
After setup, just ask Claude naturally:

> "Hey Claude, ask Gemini what the capital of France is"

If you see a response from Gemini, you're all set! 🎉

## 💬 How to Use It (Super Simple!)

Once installed, you just talk to Claude Code normally and ask it to use the other AIs. Here are real examples:

### Ask Claude to Get Multiple Opinions
> **You:** "Hey Claude, ask all the AIs what they think about using microservices vs monolith architecture"
> 
> **Claude:** I'll ask all available AIs for their perspectives on this...
> 
> *(Claude will use the `ask_all_ais` tool and show you all available AI responses)*

### Get Help Debugging Code
> **You:** "Claude, can you have Grok help debug this Python function that's running slowly?"
> 
> **Claude:** Let me ask Grok to analyze your code for performance issues...
> 
> *(Claude will use the `grok_debug` tool)*

### Compare Different AI Opinions
> **You:** "Have Gemini and ChatGPT debate whether to use React or Vue for my frontend"
> 
> **Claude:** I'll set up a debate between Gemini and ChatGPT on this topic...
> 
> *(Claude will use the `ai_debate` tool)*

### Get Code Reviews from Multiple AIs
> **You:** "Can you ask all the AIs to review this authentication function for security issues?"
> 
> **Claude:** I'll have all available AIs review your code...
> 
> *(Claude will use multiple code_review tools)*

### Brainstorm Creative Solutions
> **You:** "Ask Grok to brainstorm some creative features for my todo app"
> 
> **Claude:** Let me get Grok's creative input on your todo app...
> 
> *(Claude will use the `grok_brainstorm` tool)*

### Get Architecture Advice
> **You:** "Claude, have Gemini help design the database schema for my e-commerce site"
> 
> **Claude:** I'll ask Gemini to provide architecture recommendations...
> 
> *(Claude will use the `gemini_architecture` tool)*

**🎉 The beauty is you don't need to remember any commands - just ask Claude naturally!**

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **API keys stored locally**: All credentials are in `~/.claude-mcp-servers/multi-ai-collab/credentials.json`
- **Never committed to git**: The `.gitignore` file excludes all credential files
- **Optional AIs**: Only AIs with valid keys are loaded
- **Graceful failures**: Failed AI connections don't break the server
- **Input validation**: All requests are validated before processing

⚠️ **Important**: Never share your `credentials.json` file or commit it to version control!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**MCP not showing up?**
```bash
claude mcp list
# Should show "multi-ai-collab"
```

**AI not responding?**
```bash
mcp__multi-ai-collab__server_status
# Check which AIs are enabled and working
```

**Connection errors?**
- Verify API keys in `credentials.json`
- Check if the AI service is down
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

**Reinstall:**
```bash
claude mcp remove multi-ai-collab
./setup.sh
```
