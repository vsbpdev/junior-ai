# SecureCredentialManager Caching Fix Summary

## Problem
The `SecureCredentialManager` was being instantiated multiple times - once for each instance of `PatternDetectionEngine`. This was inefficient and could lead to:
- Unnecessary resource usage
- Multiple file locks on credential storage
- Potential race conditions in multithreaded environments
- Performance overhead from repeated initialization

## Solution
Implemented a class-level caching mechanism for `SecureCredentialManager` to ensure only one instance is created and shared across all `PatternDetectionEngine` instances.

### Changes Made

1. **Added class-level cache variables** in `pattern_detection.py`:
   ```python
   # Class-level cache for SecureCredentialManager (shared across all instances)
   _shared_credential_manager = None
   _shared_credential_lock = threading.RLock()
   ```

2. **Created a class method** to manage the shared instance:
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def _get_credential_manager(cls):
       """Get or create the shared SecureCredentialManager instance."""
       with cls._shared_credential_lock:
           if cls._shared_credential_manager is None:
               from secure_credentials import SecureCredentialManager
               cls._shared_credential_manager = SecureCredentialManager()
           return cls._shared_credential_manager
   ```

3. **Removed instance-level credential manager**:
   - Deleted `self._credential_manager = None` from `__init__`
   - Updated all references to use `self._get_credential_manager()` instead

4. **Lazy import** of `SecureCredentialManager` to avoid circular dependencies

## Test Results

The `test_credential_caching.py` script verifies:

1. **Single Instance Creation**: Only one `SecureCredentialManager` instance is created regardless of how many `PatternDetectionEngine` instances are created
2. **Shared Across Instances**: All engine instances share the same credential manager
3. **Thread Safety**: Multiple threads creating engines concurrently still only create one credential manager
4. **Lazy Initialization**: The credential manager is only created when first needed

### Test Output
```
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
Total SecureCredentialManager constructor calls: 1
The credential manager is properly cached and reused.

✅ Thread safety test passed!
Constructor calls with 20 threads: 1
Unique credential manager IDs: 1
```

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Reduced initialization overhead
- **Resource Efficiency**: Single instance manages all credential operations
- **Thread Safety**: Proper locking ensures thread-safe access
- **Consistency**: All parts of the application use the same credential source

## Implementation Notes
- The fix uses the singleton pattern at the class level
- Thread-safe implementation using `threading.RLock()`
- Lazy initialization to avoid unnecessary resource allocation
- Backward compatible - no changes to the public API
