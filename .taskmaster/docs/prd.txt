# Junior AI Assistant for Claude Code - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Transform the existing Multi-AI MCP Server into an intelligent Junior AI Assistant that proactively helps Claude Code when patterns indicate uncertainty or complexity. This system maintains all existing AI collaboration capabilities while adding smart pattern detection and automatic consultation features to improve coding accuracy and reduce errors.

## Current State Analysis

The Multi-AI MCP Server currently provides:
- Manual access to 5 AI providers (Gemini, Grok, OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter)
- Comprehensive tool set for code review, debugging, brainstorming, and architecture advice
- Collaborative features (debates, consensus, multi-AI queries)
- Individual AI specialization tools
- Robust error handling and configuration management

## Vision & Goals

### Primary Goal
Create a smart junior AI assistant that automatically detects patterns in Claude Code's work that indicate uncertainty, complexity, or potential issues, then provides proactive, accuracy-focused consultation.

### Success Metrics
- Automatic pattern detection triggers appropriate AI consultation
- Reduced coding errors through proactive review
- Maintained access to all existing AI capabilities
- Improved code accuracy without workflow disruption
- Multiple AI perspectives on critical code sections

## Core Requirements

### Phase 1: Rename & Rebrand

- Update tool prefixes: "mcp__multi-ai-collab__" → "mcp__junior-ai__"
- Update all documentation and examples
- Maintain backwards compatibility during transition

### Phase 2: Pattern Detection System
Implement comprehensive pattern detection with these categories:

#### Security Patterns
- Keywords: password, auth, token, encrypt, jwt, hash, api_key, secret, certificate, ssl, oauth, login, permission
- Action: Deep security review with multiple AIs
- Consultation: Multi-AI for comprehensive security analysis

#### Uncertainty Patterns  
- Keywords: TODO, FIXME, not sure, might be, complex, help, unsure, maybe, possibly, could be, I think, probably
- Action: Comprehensive guidance and clarification
- Consultation: Single junior AI with detailed analysis

#### Algorithm Patterns
- Keywords: sort, search, optimize, performance, O(n), algorithm, efficient, complexity, recursive, dynamic programming
- Action: Algorithm analysis and optimization
- Consultation: Multi-AI for diverse algorithmic approaches

#### Gotcha Prevention Patterns
- Keywords: regex, timezone, date, datetime, float, encoding, unicode, async, promise, callback, race condition
- Action: Deep gotcha prevention analysis
- Consultation: Single specialized AI with comprehensive warning system

#### Architecture Patterns
- Keywords: design pattern, architecture, should I, best practice, approach, structure, organize, pattern, SOLID
- Action: Architectural review and recommendations
- Consultation: Multi-AI for diverse perspectives on design decisions

### Phase 3: Hybrid Tool Structure
#### Keep All Existing Tools
- Individual AI tools (ask_gemini, ask_grok, ask_openai, ask_deepseek, ask_openrouter)
- Specialized tools (code_review, brainstorm, debug, architecture variants)
- Collaborative tools (debate, consensus, ask_all_ais)
- Maintain full manual control for explicit AI consultation

#### Add Pattern-Triggered Tools
- pattern_check: Automatic pattern detection in user input
- junior_consult: Smart consultation based on detected patterns
- deep_review: Comprehensive review using multiple AIs for critical patterns
- security_panel: Multi-AI security consultation for sensitive code
- algorithm_analysis: Multi-AI algorithm optimization consultation

### Phase 4: Accuracy-First Implementation
#### Token Philosophy
- Prioritize accuracy over token savings
- Pattern checks: ~200 tokens for comprehensive analysis
- Junior consultations: 1500-3000 tokens for detailed insights
- Multi-AI reviews: 5000+ tokens for critical sections
- No context shortcuts - provide full relevant context

#### Consultation Strategy
- Security, algorithms, architecture: Multi-AI consultation
- Uncertainty, gotchas: Single specialized AI with comprehensive analysis
- Fresh analysis each time - no caching
- Full context provided to all AIs
- Multiple clarification rounds if needed
- Complete transparency - show all AI reasoning

### Phase 5: Enhanced Configuration
